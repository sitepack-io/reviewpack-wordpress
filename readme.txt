#### What is ReviewPack?

ReviewPack is an independent external platform which ensures that you only receive reliable reviews. With many other platforms, anyone can just write a review about you, without having bought anything.

We stand for honesty. But real honesty. That's why we only allow people to leave a review who have received an order from your store.

If you are not yet using ReviewPack, [creating an account is 100% free](https://reviewpack.eu/join?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=wordpress&utm_campaign=wp_plugin) and only takes you about 30 seconds.

#### Improve your review SEO

With this plugin, you can not only gather reviews from your customers, but we will also add the required markup for the search engines. This will boost your reviews SEO, with our automated JSON+LD markup.

The markup is used by poplar search engines. They will interpret the code and might show them in the search results.

#### Automate invites with WooCommerce reviews

This plugin has a free integration with your WooCommerce store. This means that an invitation will only be sent to your customer after the order has been completed. This invitation will not be sent until you change the order status to Completed. The invitation for the review will then be scheduled in 4 days.

With this WooCommerce reviews implementation you can really increase the number of conversions which can lead to more sales.
